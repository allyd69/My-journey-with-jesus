# 40-Day Journey with Jesus Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A serene, contemplative, and modern spiritual aesthetic. The design draws inspiration from the minimalist yet warm typography of Aesop and the thoughtful, human-centric layouts of Kinfolk magazine. The core idea is to create a visual sanctuary that supports reflection, using clean design to make the ancient wisdom and modern science feel accessible and deeply personal.

### Content Density

Medium density. Each slide focuses on 1-3 key points, allowing for ample white space (around 20-25%) to create a contemplative and focused atmosphere. This approach prioritizes reflection and clarity over information overload.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #2C2A3E (Deep purple-blue, creating a meditative atmosphere)
- Primary color: #E0DCD1 (Warm cream, for main text and key elements)
- Secondary color: #A89F91 (Muted taupe, for supporting content)
- Accent color: #D4A276 (Warm gold, for highlights and emphasis)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #3D3B52
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #E0DCD1

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Oranienbaum (A modern serif with elegant, high-contrast lines, evoking a sense of timeless wisdom and grace)
  - Sorts Mill Goudy (A classic serif with a gentle, literary feel, perfect for conveying thoughtful and traditional themes)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A warm and elegant sans-serif, its excellent readability supports a clear and gentle reading experience)
  - Coda (A rounded and friendly sans-serif, offering a softer, more approachable tone for body text)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be atmospheric and evocative, focusing on soft-focus natural landscapes, quiet moments of solitude, and abstract textures like parchment or light. Avoid literal or cliché religious iconography. The style should be similar to the photography in Kinfolk magazine—natural light, muted tones, and a sense of peaceful stillness.
